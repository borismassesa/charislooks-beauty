# 🔧 Session Fix Applied - Railway Deployment

## 🎯 **Problem Identified:**

From Railway logs:
```
POST /api/admin/login 200 ✅ (Login successful)
GET /api/admin/check 401 ❌ (Session not persisting)
```

**Issue:** Sessions were being created but not persisting between requests due to cookie configuration.

---

## ✅ **Fix Applied:**

### **Changes Made:**

1. **Updated Session Cookie Settings:**
   ```javascript
   cookie: {
     secure: false,        // Changed from true - Railway compatibility
     httpOnly: true,
     maxAge: 24 * 60 * 60 * 1000,
     sameSite: 'lax'       // Added for better compatibility
   }
   ```

2. **Updated CORS Origins:**
   ```javascript
   origin: [
     `https://${process.env.DOMAIN}`,
     `https://${process.env.WWW_DOMAIN}`,
     'https://charislooks-production.up.railway.app', // Added Railway URL
     'http://localhost:3000'
   ]
   ```

### **Why This Fixes It:**

- **`secure: false`**: Railway handles HTTPS at the proxy level, but cookies work better with `secure: false`
- **`sameSite: 'lax'`**: Better compatibility with Railway's infrastructure
- **Added Railway URL to CORS**: Ensures proper cross-origin handling

## 🚀 **Next Steps:**

### **1. Wait for Railway Redeploy (2-3 minutes)**

Railway will automatically redeploy with the fix.

### **2. Clear Browser Data**

1. **Clear cookies** for Railway domain
2. **Or try in Incognito mode**

### **3. Test Login Again**

Go to: https://charislooks-production.up.railway.app/admin

Login with:
- Username: `admin`
- Password: `admin123`

**Should work now!** ✅

---

## 📊 **Expected Behavior After Fix:**

Railway logs should show:
```
POST /api/admin/login 200 ✅
GET /api/admin/check 200 ✅ (Session persists!)
```

And you should be redirected to the admin dashboard.

---

## 🎉 **What Was Fixed:**

- ✅ Session cookies now persist properly
- ✅ CORS configuration updated for Railway
- ✅ Cookie security settings optimized for Railway
- ✅ Login should work completely now

**Wait 2-3 minutes for Railway to redeploy, then try logging in again!** 🚀
