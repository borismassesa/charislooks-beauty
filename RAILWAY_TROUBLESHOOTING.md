# 🚂 Railway "Train Not Arrived" Error - Troubleshooting

## ❌ Error You're Seeing:

```
Not Found
The train has not arrived at the station.
```

This means Railway can't route traffic to your app yet.

---

## 🔍 Common Causes & Solutions

### 1. **App is Still Building/Deploying** (Most Common)

Railway might still be in the process of deploying your app.

**Solution:**
1. Go to Railway dashboard → Your project
2. Click "Deployments" tab
3. Check the latest deployment status:
   - 🟡 **Building** → Wait a few more minutes
   - 🟡 **Deploying** → Wait a bit longer
   - 🔴 **Failed** → Check the logs (see below)
   - 🟢 **Success** → Should work, try refreshing

**Wait 2-5 minutes** after seeing "Success" before the URL becomes active.

---

### 2. **Build Failed**

Your build might have failed silently.

**Solution:**
1. Railway dashboard → Deployments
2. Click the latest deployment
3. Check "Build Logs" tab for errors
4. Check "Deploy Logs" tab for runtime errors

**Look for:**
- Red error messages
- "Failed to build"
- "Command failed"
- Any error stack traces

---

### 3. **App Started But Can't Accept Connections**

The app might be running but not listening on the correct port.

**Solution:**

Railway expects your app to listen on the `PORT` environment variable.

**Check Railway Variables:**
1. Railway dashboard → Variables tab
2. Make sure `PORT` is set (Railway usually sets this automatically)
3. If not set, add: `PORT=3000`

**Our app already handles this correctly in `server/index.ts`:**
```javascript
const port = parseInt(process.env.PORT || "5000", 10);
```

---

### 4. **Missing Environment Variables**

Your app might be crashing due to missing environment variables.

**Solution:**

Check that these are set in Railway → Variables:

**Required:**
- `DATABASE_URL` - Your database connection string
- `SESSION_SECRET` - Any secure random string
- `NODE_ENV=production`

**Check:**
1. Railway dashboard → Variables tab
2. Verify all required variables are present
3. Especially check `DATABASE_URL` is valid

---

### 5. **App is Crashing on Startup**

The app might start but immediately crash.

**Solution:**

Check the runtime logs:
1. Railway dashboard → Deployments
2. Click latest deployment
3. Click "View Logs"
4. Look for error messages after "serving on port 3000"

**Common errors:**
- Database connection failed
- Missing environment variable
- Port already in use
- Import/module errors

## 🔧 Step-by-Step Debugging

### Step 1: Check Deployment Status

```
Railway Dashboard
  └─ Your Project
      └─ Deployments tab
          └─ Latest deployment
              ├─ Status: Building/Success/Failed?
              ├─ Build Logs: Any errors?
              └─ Deploy Logs: Any runtime errors?
```

### Step 2: Check Environment Variables

**Required variables in Railway:**
```
DATABASE_URL=postgresql://...
SESSION_SECRET=your-random-string
NODE_ENV=production
```

**Optional but recommended:**
```
PORT=3000
DOMAIN=your-railway-url.up.railway.app
```

### Step 3: Check Service Settings

1. Railway dashboard → Your service
2. Check "Settings" tab
3. Verify:
   - **Start Command:** Should be `npm run start:prod`
   - **Build Command:** Should be `npm run build:prod`
   - **Root Directory:** Should be `/` (root)

### Step 4: Force Redeploy

Sometimes Railway needs a fresh deployment:

1. Railway dashboard → Deployments
2. Click the three dots menu (⋯)
3. Click "Redeploy"
4. Wait for the new deployment to complete

## 🎯 Quick Checklist

- [ ] Deployment shows "Success" status
- [ ] Waited 2-5 minutes after success
- [ ] DATABASE_URL is set in Railway variables
- [ ] SESSION_SECRET is set in Railway variables
- [ ] NODE_ENV=production is set
- [ ] Build logs show no errors
- [ ] Deploy logs show "serving on port 3000"
- [ ] No error messages after the server starts

---

## 📊 What Railway Logs Should Look Like

**Healthy deployment logs:**
```
Starting...
npm run start:prod
> charislooks-beauty@1.0.0 start:prod
> NODE_ENV=production node dist/index.js

4:56:21 AM [express] serving on port 3000
```

**Then it should stay running (not exit or crash).**

---

## 🆘 Common Error Patterns

### Error: "Cannot find module"
**Fix:** Rebuild the project
```bash
# Locally
npm run build:prod
git add -A
git commit -m "Rebuild"
git push
```

### Error: "ENOTFOUND" or database connection
**Fix:** Check DATABASE_URL in Railway variables

### Error: "Port already in use"
**Fix:** Railway should handle this automatically, try redeploying

### Logs stop immediately after "serving on port 3000"
**Fix:** App is probably crashing. Check for error messages in logs

## 🔍 How to Check Railway Logs

### Method 1: Dashboard
1. Railway dashboard
2. Your project
3. Click the service/deployment
4. "View Logs" button

### Method 2: Watch Live Logs
1. Railway dashboard
2. Your project
3. Logs section (left sidebar)
4. Live logs will stream

**Look for:**
- Any red error messages
- Stack traces
- "Error:" or "Failed:" messages
- Process exit messages

---

## ✅ Working App Indicators

You know it's working when:

1. ✅ Deployment status shows "Success"
2. ✅ Logs show "serving on port 3000"
3. ✅ No error messages after that
4. ✅ Logs continue streaming (app stays running)
5. ✅ URL opens your homepage (not error page)

---

## 🚀 Force a Clean Deployment

If nothing works, try this:

1. **Locally rebuild:**
   ```bash
   npm run build:prod
   ```

2. **Commit and push:**
   ```bash
   git add dist/
   git commit -m "Force rebuild for Railway"
   git push origin main
   ```

3. **In Railway:**
   - Wait for automatic redeploy
   - Or manually trigger redeploy

---

## 📞 What to Share If You Need Help

If you're still stuck, share:

1. **Deployment status** (Success/Failed?)
2. **Last 20 lines of Deploy Logs**
3. **Any error messages** (copy the full error)
4. **Environment variables** (names only, not values!)

---

## 🎯 Most Likely Fix

**9 out of 10 times, it's one of these:**

1. **Wait longer** - Give it 5 minutes after "Success"
2. **Missing DATABASE_URL** - Add it to Railway variables
3. **Build failed** - Check build logs for errors
4. **App crashed** - Check deploy logs for runtime errors

**Start with checking your Railway deployment logs!**
