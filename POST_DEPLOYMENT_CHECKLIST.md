# üéâ Post-Deployment Checklist

**Status:** Railway deployment successful! ‚úÖ

Now let's make sure everything is properly configured and working.

---

## ‚úÖ Step 1: Verify Your Live URL

### Find Your Railway URL:
1. Go to Railway dashboard: https://railway.app
2. Click on your `charislooks-beauty` project
3. Look for the deployment URL (something like):
   ```
   https://charislooks-beauty-production.up.railway.app
   ```

### Quick Test:
Visit your URL and check:
- [ ] Homepage loads (you should see the CharisLooks Beauty landing page)
- [ ] Images display properly
- [ ] Navigation works (Portfolio, Services, Contact pages)

**If homepage loads:** ‚úÖ Deployment successful!
**If you see errors:** Check Railway logs (see troubleshooting section below)

---

## üóÑÔ∏è Step 2: Initialize Database (CRITICAL)

Your database needs tables created. You have two options:

### Option A: Using Railway CLI (Recommended)

If you have Railway CLI installed:
```bash
railway login
railway link
railway run npm run db:push:prod
```

### Option B: Using Local Connection (Easier)

1. **Get your DATABASE_URL from Railway:**
   - Go to Railway dashboard
   - Click your project ‚Üí Variables tab
   - Copy the `DATABASE_URL` value

2. **Temporarily add to local .env:**
   ```bash
   # Create or edit .env file
   DATABASE_URL=postgresql://your-neon-connection-string-here
   NODE_ENV=production
   ```

3. **Run database push:**
   ```bash
   npm run db:push:prod
   ```

4. **Remove from .env after** (for security)

### What This Does:
Creates all database tables:
- ‚úÖ services
- ‚úÖ appointments
- ‚úÖ portfolio_items
- ‚úÖ contact_messages
- ‚úÖ admin_users
- ‚úÖ testimonials
- ‚úÖ promotional_banners

## üîê Step 3: Test Admin Access

### Try Logging In:
1. Go to: `https://your-railway-url.up.railway.app/admin`
2. Use default credentials:
   - **Username:** `admin`
   - **Password:** `admin123`

### Expected Results:

**‚úÖ If login works:**
- You see the admin dashboard
- Can view services, portfolio, appointments
- Everything looks good!

**‚ùå If login fails or shows errors:**
- Check Railway logs
- Verify database was initialized (Step 2)
- See troubleshooting section below

---

## üîí Step 4: Change Admin Password (CRITICAL!)

**‚ö†Ô∏è SECURITY ALERT:** Change the default password immediately!

### How to Change Password:

1. **Log in to admin panel** (`/admin`)
2. **Go to Profile or Settings** (if available)
3. **Change your password** to something secure

**OR** manually in database:
```bash
# If you need to reset manually, you'll need to hash a new password
# Contact me if you need help with this
```

**Why this matters:** Default credentials are public in the code repository. Anyone can see them!
