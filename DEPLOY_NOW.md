## Step 1: Push Your Code to GitHub (2 minutes)

Your changes are committed locally. Now push them to GitHub:

```bash
cd /Users/boris/projects/charislooks-beauty
git push origin main
```

If you need to authenticate, GitHub will prompt you. Once pushed, verify at:
`https://github.com/borismassesa/charislooks-beauty`

## Step 2: Set Up Database on Neon (3 minutes)

You need a PostgreSQL database. We'll use Neon (free tier):

### A. Create Neon Account
1. Go to: https://neon.tech
2. Sign up with GitHub (easiest)
3. Click "Create a project"
4. Name it: `charislooks-beauty`
5. Select region: `US East (Ohio)` or closest to you

### B. Get Your Connection String
1. After project creation, you'll see the connection string
2. It looks like:
   ```
   postgresql://username:password@ep-xxx.us-east-1.aws.neon.tech/neondb?sslmode=require
   ```
3. **Copy this** - you'll need it for Railway!

### C. Configure Environment Variables

While the build is running, set up environment variables:

1. Click on your project
2. Go to "Variables" tab
3. Click "New Variable" and add these:

#### Required Variables:

**DATABASE_URL**
```
[Paste your Neon connection string from Step 2]

**DOMAIN** (leave for later)

your-app-name.up.railway.app
```

**WWW_DOMAIN** (leave for later)
```
www.your-app-name.up.railway.app
```

4. Click "Deploy" after adding variables (if build already completed, it will redeploy)

## Step 4: Initialize Database Schema (2 minutes)

After Railway deployment completes, you need to set up the database tables.

### Option A: Using Railway CLI (Recommended)

If you have Railway CLI installed:
```bash
cd /Users/boris/projects/charislooks-beauty
railway login
railway link
railway run npm run db:push:prod
```

### Option B: Using Local Connection

1. In your local `.env` file, temporarily add your Neon DATABASE_URL
2. Run:
   ```bash
   npm run db:push:prod
   ```
3. Remove the DATABASE_URL from local `.env` after

## Step 5: Access Your Live Application (1 minute)

### A. Find Your Railway URL
1. In Railway dashboard, go to your project
2. Click on the "Deployments" tab
3. Find the latest deployment
4. Copy the URL (looks like: `https://charislooks-beauty-production.up.railway.app`)

### B. Test Your Application
Open the URL and verify:
- ‚úÖ Homepage loads
- ‚úÖ Portfolio page displays
- ‚úÖ Services page works
- ‚úÖ Contact form submits
- ‚úÖ Admin login works at `/admin`

**Default Admin Credentials:**
- Username: `admin`
- Password: `admin123`

‚ö†Ô∏è **IMPORTANT:** Change these immediately after login!

## Step 6: Configure Custom Domain (Optional - 5 minutes)

If you have a custom domain (like charislooks.com):

### A. In Railway Dashboard
1. Go to Settings ‚Üí Domains
2. Click "Add Domain"
3. Enter your domain: `charislooks.com`
4. Railway will show you DNS records to add

### B. In Your Domain Provider (Hostinger, GoDaddy, etc.)
Add these DNS records:

**CNAME Record:**
```
Type: CNAME
Name: www
Value: [Railway's CNAME value]
TTL: 3600
```

**A Record or CNAME for root:**
```
Type: CNAME (or as Railway specifies)
Name: @ or root
